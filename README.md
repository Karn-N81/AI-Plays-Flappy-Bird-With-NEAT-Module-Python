# AI-Plays-Flappy-Bird-With-NEAT-Module-Python
Programmed the game of Flappy Bird using Python and the Module NEAT Python. Building a
version of flappy bird using pygame and implementing the Evolutionary NEAT Algorithm to build an AI that
can play the game.

NEAT is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural networks.
NEAT-Python is a pure Python implementation of NEAT, with no dependencies other than the Python standard library.

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks. 
For a detailed description of the algorithm, you should probably go read some of Stanleyâ€™s papers on his website.

Currently this library supports Python versions 3.6 through 3.11, as well as PyPy 3.
